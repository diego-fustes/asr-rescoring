Rescoring methods for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition. The python scripts in this repository cover the following features:

* Fine-tune a GPT-2 language model given a custom dataset
* Run speech recognition on a given WAV file and get the list of transcription candidates
* Score a list of phrases (rescoring) with a language model (e.g. the fine-tuned GPT2)
